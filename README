rQuip is a utility for solving the "crypto-quip" in the Sunday newspaper. It
tries to decrypt a monoalphabetic substitution encrypted string by working off
of known letter frequencies. It replaces the cyphertext alphabet with what it
thinks it should be based off of statistical frequency. In order to test it I
wrote a monoalphabetic character substitution encryption class called Quip.
